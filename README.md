## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
You can install this plugin via the command-line or the WordPress admin panel.

### via Command-line
If you're [using Composer to manage WordPress](https://roots.io/using-composer-with-wordpress/), add **ResponsivePics** to your project's dependencies.

```sh
composer require clarifynl/responsive-pics
```
Then activate the plugin via [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/commands/plugin/activate/).

```sh
wp plugin activate responsive-pics
```

### via WordPress Admin Panel
1. Download the [latest zip](https://github.com/clarifynl/responsive-pics/releases/latest) of this repo.
2. In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to **Plugins->Add New**
3. Click **Upload Plugin**
4. Upload the zip file that you downloaded.
5. **Activate** the plugin after installation.

### Browser Support
Currently the `<picture>` element and `srcset` and `sizes` attributes on the `<img>` element are supported in all modern browsers except **Internet Explorer 11**.

In order to enable support for the picture element and associated features in browsers that do not yet support them, you can use a polyfill. We recommend using [Picturefill](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/).

To install **Picturefill** in your wordpress theme as a node module, run the following command from your theme directory:

#### npm
`npm install --save picturefill`
#### Yarn
`yarn add picturefill`

And import the package in your theme’s global javascript file:
`import 'picturefill';`

## Configuration <a name="configuration"></a>
ResponsivePics uses the following default variables:

| Variable                  | Type    | Default    | Definition
| ------------------------- | ------- | ---------- | ----------
| `$columns`                | number  | `12`       | The amount of columns your grid layout uses
| `$gutter`                 | number  | `30`       | The gutter width in pixels (space between grid columns)
| `$breakpoints`            | array   | `['xs' => 0, 'sm' => 576, 'md' => 768, 'lg' => 992, 'xl' => 1200, 'xxl' => 1400]` | The media query breakpoints ResponsivePics will use for creating and serving your image sources
| `$grid_widths`            | array   | `['xs' => 576, 'sm' => 540, 'md' => 720, 'lg' => 960, 'xl' => 1140, 'xxl' => 1320]` | The maximum widths of your layout in pixels ResponsivePics will use for resizing your images
| `$max_width_factor`       | number  | `2`        | The maximum factor of the width to use for resizing and cropping the height of an image source
| `$lazyload_class`         | string  | `lazyload` | The css class to be added on the `img` tag when `lazyload` is enabled
| `$lqip_width`             | number  | `100`      | The image width to be used for the `LQIP` (low quality image placeholder)
| `$lqip_class`             | string  | `blur-up`  | The css class to be added on the `img` tag when `LQIP` (low quality image placeholder) is enabled
| `$image_quality`          | number  | `90`       | The image compression quality in percentage used in the `WP_Image_Editor` when resizing images
| `$wp_rest_cache`          | boolean | `false`    | Wether to enable cache in the WP Rest API response headers
| `$wp_rest_cache_duration` | number  | `3600`     | The cache duration (max-age) in seconds of the WP Rest API Cache-Control header

By default, ResponsivePics will use the [Bootstrap 4 SCSS variables](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/main/scss/_variables.scss#L285/) for defining:

The amount of **grid columns**: `$grid-columns: 12;`  
The **grid gutter width** in pixels: `$grid-gutter-width: 30px;`  
The **grid breakpoints** in pixels:

```scss
$grid-breakpoints: (
  xs: 0,
  sm: 576px,
  md: 768px,
  lg: 992px,
  xl: 1200px,
  xxl: 1400px
);
```
And the **maximum widths of the containers** in pixels:

```scss
$container-max-widths: (
  sm: 540px,
  md: 720px,
  lg: 960px,
  xl: 1140px,
  xxl: 1320px
);
```

*Note: ResponsivePics will add the `xs` container max width for you (= 576), based upon the default sm grid breakpoint (= 576px).*

If you have customized the bootstrap defaults or if you’re using a different grid system ([Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com) etc.), or even if you want to add extra breakpoints & container widths, you can pass your own grid variables to the ResponsivePics library.

Add these lines to your theme’s **functions.php** and make sure to check if the `ResponsivePics` class exists:

```php
/*
 * Set ResponsivePics variables
 */
if (class_exists('ResponsivePics')) {
  ResponsivePics::setColumns(12);
  ResponsivePics::setGutter(30);
  ResponsivePics::setBreakPoints([
    'xs'    => 0,
    'sm'    => 576,
    'md'    => 768,
    'lg'    => 992,
    'xl'    => 1200,
    'xxl'   => 1400,
    'xxxl'  => 1600,
    'xxxxl' => 1920
  ]);
  ResponsivePics::setGridWidths([
    'xs'    => 576,
    'sm'    => 768,
    'md'    => 992,
    'lg'    => 1200,
    'xl'    => 1400,
    'xxl'   => 1600,
    'xxxl'  => 1920
  ]);
  ResponsivePics::setMaxWidthFactor(4);
  ResponsivePics::setLazyLoadClass('lozad');
  ResponsivePics::setLqipWidth(200);
  ResponsivePics::setLqipClass('blurred');
  ResponsivePics::setImageQuality(85);
  ResponsivePics::setRestApiCache(true);
  ResponsivePics::setRestApiCacheDuration(86400);
}
```

Any other image formats, will not be resizes or cropped.

---

## Sizes <a name="sizes"></a>

### Image sizes
The following syntax is available for each image size in the `sizes` parameter:

```php
breakpoint:width
```

| Parameter  | Type             | Required | Default | Definition
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------
| breakpoint | number or string | yes      |         | If undefined, and `width` is a number, breakpoint will be the same as the width. If undefined, and `width` is a column definition, breakpoint will be the corresponding breakpoint (e.g. if width is `'xs-8'`, breakpoint will be `'xs'`).
| width      | number or string | yes      |         | A column definition is a key in `$grid_widths` plus a dash and a column span number (e.g. `'xs-8'`).<br>If the column span number is suffixed with `-full` (e.g. `'xs-8-full'`), the column width is calculated as a percentage of the `$grid_width`, but as the next matching `$breakpoint` width (like in a `.container-fluid`).<br>You can also use `full` as span number (e.g. `'xs-full'`) for full width size based upon next matching `$breakpoint` width.

### Picture & background sizes
Since the `<picture>` element and background images support art directed images, the following full syntax is available for each image size in the `sizes` parameter:

```php
breakpoint:width [/factor|height]|crop_x crop_y
```

The following parameters are available in the sizes syntax:

| Parameter  | Type             | Required | Default | Definition
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------------
| breakpoint | number or string | yes      |         | If undefined, and `width` is a number, breakpoint will be the same as the width. If undefined, and `width` is a column definition, breakpoint will be the corresponding breakpoint (e.g. if width is `'xs-8'`, breakpoint will be `'xs'`).
| width      | number or string | yes      |         | The desired (max) width of the image (e.g. `800`). A column definition is a key in `$grid_widths` plus a dash and a column span number (e.g. `'xs-8'`).<br>If the column span number is suffixed with `-full` (e.g. `'xs-8-full'`), the column width is calculated as a percentage of the `$grid_width`, but as the next matching `$breakpoint` width (like in a `.container-fluid`).<br>You can also use `full` as span number (e.g. `'xs-full'`) for full width size based upon next matching `$breakpoint` width.
| height     | number           | optional |         | The desired (max) height of the image (e.g. `500`).
| factor     | number           | optional |         | A crop-factor of the width for the desired height within the default range of `0-2` (e.g. `0.75`).
| crop_x     | number or string | optional | c       | Crop position in horizontal direction (e.g. `c`). See the [Cropping section](#cropping) for more information.
| crop_y     | number or string | optional | c       | Crop position in vertical direction  (e.g. `b`). See the [Cropping section](#cropping) for more information.

---

## Cropping <a name="cropping"></a>

The following options are available as valid crop positions:

### Crop position shorthands
You can use the following crop position shorthands in horizontal direction (x):
* `l`: left
* `c`: center
* `r`: right
* `f`: focal point (See the [Focal Point section](#focal-point) for more information)

And in vertical direction (y):
* `t`: top
* `c`: center
* `b`: bottom

If the vertical direction is not set, the horizontal direction `x` will be treated as a shortcut:
* `c`: center center
* `t`: top center
* `r`: right center
* `b`: center bottom
* `l`: left center
* `f`: focal point (See the [Focal Point section](#focal-point) for more information)

### Crop position percentages
You can also use percentages as valid crop position syntax:
* `75 10`: 75% from left, 10% from top
* `25 80`: 25% from left, 80% from top
* `50 100`: 50% from left, 100% from top (equals `center bottom`)

In this case both the coordinates `x` and `y` need to be passed.

### Focal Point <a name="focal-point"></a>
When you want to crop an image but keep a certain area of the image in view, you can use the `f(ocal)` shorthand feature. In order to set this focal area of an image, we added a **focal point picker** interface to several views of the Wordpress media framework.

#### Attachment Details
When clicking on a thumbnail from the Wordpress Media Library grid view, you will see the `Attachment details` modal. This will be the most accurate view to select your focal point:
![Attachment Details Focal Point Picker](/assets/images/attachment-details-focal-point-picker.jpg "Attachment Details Two Columns Focal Point Picker")

#### Featured Image
When setting or replacing an featured image in a page or post, you will see the `Featured image` modal. In this view you can select your focal point in the thumbnail at the top of the right sidebar:
![Featured Image Focal Point Picker](/assets/images/featured-image-focal-point-picker.jpg "Featured Image Focal Point Picker")

#### Edit Image
When uploading or editing an image in the WYSIWYG editor or meta field in a page or post, you will see the `Edit image` modal. In this view you can select your focal point in the thumbnail at the top left:
![Edit Image Focal Point Picker](/assets/images/edit-image-focal-point-picker.jpg "Edit Image Focal Point Picker")

There are 3 ways you can set the focal point of an image with the interface:

* By directly clicking on the desired focal point in the image.
* By dragging and dropping the focal point circle element on the image.
* By entering the Focal Point X & Y-axis values as percentages directly in the attachment input fields.

By using one of these options a post meta key named `responsive_pics_focal_point` will be added or updated to the attachment with an array value containing the x & y coordinates as percentages:
```php
[
  'x' => '86',
  'y' => '39'
]
```
To use this value elsewhere in your theme, you can retrieve it by calling:
```php
$focal_point = get_post_meta($attachment_id, 'responsive_pics_focal_point', true);
```

---

## Process <a name="process"></a>

1. When visiting a front-end page and a `ResponsivePics` function call is made, this library will add the resize and/or crop image task as a job to the background process queue using [Action Scheduler](https://actionscheduler.org/).
2. On every page load or on the next cron interval, **Action Scheduler** will run the next batch of jobs in the background process queue. See the [Cron section](#cron) for more information.
3. When a job is up next in the queue and ready to be processed it will execute the resize and/or crop task and save the image in the same location as the original image when successful and it will remove the job from the queue.
4. Once the image variation is created, it will skip the process of that variation on the next page load.
5. When you change one of the image size parameters, it will automatically try and create the new image variation on the next page load.
6. When the original image does not meet the dimension requirements of the requested image size, it will skip that image size variation and proceed to the next image size.
7. Alt text will automatically be added on the picture img element if the original image in the media library has one.
8. When deleting an attachment from the library, it will also delete all the resized images created by this plugin.

### Background Processing <a name="background-processing"></a>

The background processing library [Action Scheduler](https://actionscheduler.org/) has a built in administration screen for monitoring, debugging and manually triggering scheduled image resize jobs. The administration interface is accesible via:
```php
Tools > Scheduled Actions
```
Every resize job will be grouped by it's wordpress image id

### Cron <a name="cron"></a>
When you are using the built-in [WP-Cron](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/), the background process queue will only process any tasks on every page load.  
If you have disabled `WP-Cron` in your setup and you are using your own cron job on your server, Action Scheduler will use the interval set in that cron job to process the next batch of jobs.

```php
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
```

If you're using [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/) like us ❤️, the default cron interval is set to every [15 mins](https://github.com/roots/trellis/blob/master/roles/wordpress-setup/tasks/main.yml#L49).  
You can override this to for example 1 mins with setting the `cron_interval` (or `cron_interval_multisite` for multisite) variable per wordpress site to `*/1`:

In for example **trellis/group_vars/development/wordpress_sites.yml**:

```yaml
wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    site_hosts:
      - canonical: example.test
        redirects:
          - www.example.test
    local_path: ../site # path targeting local Bedrock site directory (relative to Ansible root)
    admin_email: admin@example.test
    multisite:
      enabled: false
    ssl:
      enabled: false
      provider: self-signed
    cache:
      enabled: false
    cron_interval: '*/1'
```

Don't forget to re-provision your server after changing this value.

### Error handling

If an error occurs during the resizing process or if there's invalid syntax, ResponsivePics will display or return an error.

#### PHP
<pre>
<b>ResponsivePics errors</b>
- breakpoint xxs is neither defined nor a number
</pre>

#### REST API
```json
{
  "code": "responsive_pics_invalid",
  "message": "breakpoint xxs is neither defined nor a number",

## Features <a name="features"></a>

### S3 Offload <a name="s3-offload"></a>
When you installed and activated the [WP Offload Media (Lite)](https://nl.wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/) plugin, this library automatically:

* Will offload any resized/cropped image generated by this plugin to your configured S3 storage provider.
* Will delete any resized/cropped image generated by this plugin in your configured S3 storage provider when deleting an attachment.

> #### NOTE
> When the *Remove Files From Server* option is activated in the *Offload Media Lite* settings, this plugin will **NOT** remove any resized/cropped image generated by this plugin!

### Lazyloading <a name="lazyloading"></a>
When enabling the `lazyload` option in the `get_picture` or `get_image` functions or API endpoints with a boolean value `true`, this library automatically:

* adds a `lazyload` class to the `<img>` element.
* swaps the `srcset` with `data-srcset` attribute on the picture `<source>` or the `<img>` elements.

This will enable you to use a lazy loading plugin such as Lazysizes.

You can also set your own lazyload class by passing it to **ResponsivePics** library in your theme’s **functions.php**:
```php
if (class_exists('ResponsivePics')) {
  ResponsivePics::setLazyLoadClass('lazy');
}
```
To install **Lazysizes** in your wordpress theme as a node module, run the following command from your theme directory:
#### npm
`npm install --save lazysizes`
#### Yarn
`yarn add lazysizes`

And import the package in your theme’s global javascript file:
```javascript
import 'lazysizes';
```
When enabling `lazyload` with a string value `native`, this library automatically:

* adds the native `loading="lazy"` attribute to the `<img>` element.

### LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholder) <a name="lqip"></a>
When enabling the `lqip` option in the `get_image` function or `/responsive-pics/v1/image` API endpoint, this library automatically:

* adds a `blur-up` class to the `<img>` element.
* adds a fallback `src` attribute on the `<img>` element with a low quality placeholder image with a default width of 100px.

This will enable you to style your placeholder image before the actual high quality image is loaded.

You can also set your own `lqip` class by passing it to **ResponsivePics** library in your theme’s **functions.php**:
```php
if (class_exists('ResponsivePics')) {
  ResponsivePics::setLqipClass('blurred');
}
```

### Intrinsic Aspectratio <a name="intrinsic"></a>
When enabling the `intrinsic` option in the `get_picture` function or `/responsive-pics/v1/picture` API endpoint, this library automatically:

* adds a intrinsic class to the `<picture>` element and a `intrinsic__item` class to the picture `<img>` element.
* adds `data-aspectratio` attributes on the picture `<source>` and `<img>` elements with the calculated source image ratio.

This will enable you to pre-occupy the space needed for an image by calculating the height from the image width or the width from the height with an intrinsic plugin such as the [lazysizes aspectratio extension](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes/tree/gh-pages/plugins/aspectratio).

To use the **Lazysizes aspectratio extension** in your wordpress theme, first install **lazysizes** as a node module as described in the [Lazyloading section](#lazyloading) and import the extension in your theme’s global javascript file:
```javascript
import 'lazysizes/plugins/aspectratio/ls.aspectratio.js';
```
